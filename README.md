# Android-Sensor-Readings-Uploader

Depending on the values set in the settings this app will sample sensors
and upload (with a HTTP POST) the readings to a provided URL.

The app starts automatically after power-on and operates in the background.

To convert the ZIP file with recorded sensor sample data to an XLSX spreadsheet
use the script [excel.py](scripts/excel.py).

You can view (and install) the app on the Google Play Store
[here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=altermarkive.uploader)
