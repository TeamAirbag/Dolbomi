Tabs-Synchronized-Zoom-Pan-Android-App
======================================

Porting a piece of software to Java I had a requirement to draw plots
on multiple tabs and at the same time synchronize the zoom and horizontal pan
between them.

This class implements a UI with tabs where the zoom an horizontal pan are
synchronized across the tabs. Zooming the content of the tabs can be steered
with a pinch.
